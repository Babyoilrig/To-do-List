To Do List
===========



This is a simple app which I created when I was learning to use React. 
<br/><br/>

It allows users to add items to a to do list, and also remove them using the ‘x’ button.

 Please note this app is not finished - and has not been styled at all. I am looking forward to finishing this project, and making it look fantastic!
